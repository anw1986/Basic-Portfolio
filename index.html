                <p>Howdy! My name is Ahmed. This is my first wack at learning full stack. My exposure to prgramming has been limited with writing scripts in VBA, Python and other visualization software for data analysis. Web development has always amazed me & I am rolling up my sleeves to learn & challenge myself in Full Stack.
                </p>

                <p>A little about me!! I graduated with a Masters in Industrial Engineering from UT, Hookem \m/. I am thorough with data analysis and like utlizing analytical and statistical modeling for decision support. I am interested in financial markets and algorithms in financial trading. I enjoy reading blogs on financial markets & retirement planning. Seeking alpha is on my Favorite bar but recently it has become a paid content. Sigh!! My interest with Financial Markets started with Tesla, i.e., how a company with negative cash flow has not gone belly up. This curiousity led me to understand on working of financial markets. Hopefully, I would be able to utilize the full stack skills learnt to develop something related to Fintech </p>
                <br>
                <p>In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my wife & my 10 month old. Yes! I am voracious reader. These days I am reading Grit by Angela Duckworth. Next on my reading list are books by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. Also I enjoy maximizng points on credit card & closely follow The Points Guy! This guy quit Morgan Stanley to startup a company just based on travel & points. </p>
                <br>
                <p>I'll be updaing my portfolio continously and adding new features. Do check it out & stay curious \m/</p>
